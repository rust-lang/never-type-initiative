# 2022-01: Lang team update

## Summary

* Work has started on inlining problems/evaluations from issues, gists, etc.
  See [no inference changes](../evaluation/no-inference-changes.md),
  [PRs/issues](../evaluation/issues.md); the no inference changes page is likely
  mostly complete. Some other pages are also available but in more draft status.

## Goals for this month

* Continue to fill out scenarios, particularly explanations of current
  feature-gated state and the effects (breakage, expectations for next steps).

## Questions for discussion, meeting proposals

* No particular all-lang questions yet. Current trajectory suggests that we will
  have a complete-ish set of documents for lang review in 1-2 months, depending
  on bandwidth. Current expectation is that we have a roughly ready nightly
  implementation, but more work is needed to document it and the tradeoffs it
  makes.
